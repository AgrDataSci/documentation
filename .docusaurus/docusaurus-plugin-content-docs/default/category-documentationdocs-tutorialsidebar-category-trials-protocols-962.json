The protocol provides an overview of the data collection moments during the trials and the variables and traits collected at each data collection moment. Farmers evaluate varieties in their on-farm trials and provide comparative observations by ranking the varieties based on their performance throughout their growth and post-harvest qualities including taste and consumption preferences.",
