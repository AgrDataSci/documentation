## Guide

Jacob van Etten, Rhys Manners, Jonathan Steinke, Elsa Matthus, Kauê de Sousa. 2020. The tricot approach. Guide for large-scale participatory experiments. Rome (Italy): Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT. https://hdl.handle.net/10568/109942

This is a short, full-colour guide intended for practitioners who are not yet familiar with tricot. It explains the rationale of tricot and gives an overview of the experimental cycle.

## Main publications

All publications about the tricot approach are free and open access.

* Jonathan Steinke, Jacob van Etten and Pablo Mejía-Zelan. 2017. The accuracy of farmer-generated data in an agricultural citizen science methodology. Agronomy for Sustainable Development 37: 32. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-017-0441-y

The above paper shows that farmers provide accurate data in tricot trials. Their rankings converge with expert rankings for four traits. The variation between farmers still allows for accurate overall ranking of the varieties.

* Eskender Beza, Jonathan Steinke, Jacob van Etten et al. 2017. What are the prospects for large-N citizen science in agriculture? Evidence from three continents on motivation and mobile telephone use of resource-poor farmers participating in “tricot” crop research trials. PLoS ONE 12(5): e0175700. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175700

This paper investigates the motivation of farmers who participate in tricot trials across three contrasting contexts: Honduras, Ethiopia and India. Farmers are motivated by a wide range of reasons, including intrinsic and extrinsic factors. They do not see it as a pastime, but also do not expect monetary compensation. They expect technical information and access to seeds as reward of their participation.
