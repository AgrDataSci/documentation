* **Jonathan Steinke, Jacob van Etten and Pablo Mejía-Zelan. 2017.  
  The accuracy of farmer-generated data in an agricultural citizen science methodology.**  
  Agronomy for Sustainable Development 37: 32. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-017-0441-y  

  The above paper shows that farmers provide accurate data in tricot trials. Their rankings converge with expert rankings for four traits. The variation between farmers still allows for accurate overall ranking of the varieties.

* **Eskender Beza, Jonathan Steinke, Jacob van Etten et al. 2017.  
  What are the prospects for large-N citizen science in agriculture? Evidence from three continents on motivation and mobile telephone use of resource-poor farmers participating in “tricot” crop research trials.**  
  PLoS ONE 12(5): e0175700. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0175700  

  This paper investigates the motivation of farmers who participate in tricot trials across three contrasting contexts: Honduras, Ethiopia and India. Farmers are motivated by a wide range of reasons, including intrinsic and extrinsic factors. They do not see it as a pastime, but also do not expect monetary compensation. They expect technical information and access to seeds as reward of their participation.

  Group-based and citizen science on-farm variety selection approaches for bean growers in Central America.**  
  Agricultural Economics. https://doi.org/10.1111/agec.12819  

  This paper found that both tricot-PVS and traditional group-PVS participation equally promoted on-farm varietal diversification among Central American bean growers, but group-PVS more effectively enhanced household food security—likely due to its positive impact on agronomic management.

* **Rachel Voss, Kauê de Sousa, Sognigbé N'Danikou, […] Maarten van Zonneveld. 2025.  
  Citizen science informs demand-driven breeding of opportunity crops.**  
  Plants, People, Planet, 1–14. https://doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.70035  

  This paper used tricot trials with 2,063 farmers in West and East Africa, showing that farmer preferences for leafy amaranth varied by traits and demographics, guiding demand-driven breeding.

* **K. Sharma, E. Atieno, J. Mugo, K. de Sousa, J. van Etten, S. Nyawade. 2025.
