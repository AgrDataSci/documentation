# Trial Observation 

As the crop grows, the farmers observe the technologies and record their observations on the observation card. For many farmers, the questions asked in tricot pose a new way of looking at things.

Most farmers can tell which of the three technology options they generally like best. But it is not always easy to decide which one is the best for a specific evaluation criterion. 

The farmers observe and evaluate the technology options in their trials and focus on only one criterion at a time. The observations they make always follow the same structure: the ‘best’ and the ‘worst’ among the three trial technologies need to be identified. Farmers mark their choices on the appropriate page of the observation card. On the card, the question is asked in as few words as possible to make it easier for farmers. For example, instead of asking ‘Which of the three varieties has developed the best foliage?’ the observation card just asks: ‘Best foliage?’.

### Focus on one criterion at a time

Sometimes it is hard to acknowledge that a technology option was not successful for one criterion, but still performed best for another. For example, imagine a maize variety that was heavily affected by drought and disease and hardly produced yield, but has an excellent growth habit, with many tillers. It could look poor overall but would still be ‘best’ for ‘growth habit’. For best results, it is crucial to really focus on only one criterion at a time and ignore all others.

### Choose the right dates for the evaluation

Appropriate timing is important, and farmers should be told at which point in the process each criterion needs to be evaluated. For fertilizers or varieties, it is common to evaluate the trial in three stages: earlier-developing criteria (for example, foliage development), later-developing criteria (for example, disease resistance) and post-harvest criteria (for example, yield or market value). The project implementers should suggest the evaluation steps and dates to the farmers.

### Provide follow-up assistance

Many farmers have a busy life and their tricot trial will be one activity among many others. Through telephone calls, the project implementers or the local field agents may help the farmers to keep track of their evaluations and remind them of upcoming observation steps. The telephone calls will also help to clarify open questions and to let farmers know that their contribution is important and valuable. Within their own capacities, the local field agents may also support farmers directly in the evaluation at the plot. These follow-up calls can also be used to support the data compilation if farmers mention that they have already collected their data.

### 12. Trial data collection

Once farmers have started their on-farm trials, the next step is to collect the data generated at the different data collection moments. For each moment, ClimMob generates a specific form with tailored questions. Data can be collected using ODK Collect (recommended) or, alternatively, by uploading an Excel file to the ClimMob platform.

Using ODK Collect (recommended)

1. Each field agent opens ODK Collect on their phone.

2. Tap the three dots (top-right) → Get blank form → select the data collection form.

3. For the first data collection moment:

* Choose Fill blank form

* Select the participant

* Enter the data

* Send the finalized form

4. Back in the ClimMob platform, the project administrator must:

* Check the collected data and correct if necessary (from the main dashboard, click View data on the right side and select the parameters to review).

* Once verified, go to the main menu, finish the first data collection, and start the next assessment.

5. Repeat this process until all data collection points are completed.
Actions in ODK Collect:

Cancel form: Permanently deletes the form. No further data can be collected, and any existing data will also be deleted. Using Excel (not recommended)

1. In the ClimMob dashboard, go to the main menu (left side) and click Upload data (green button).

2. Click Create template. The Excel template will be generated and saved in your Downloads as Excel template for uploading assessment form data.

3. Fill in the template with the collected data.

4. Return to the ClimMob main menu → Upload data (green button) → upload the completed Excel file.

**Submit data from a browser**

To fill out forms online supported by Enketo, the field agents (enumerators) need to log in using their credentials (username and password). Here we do a quick explanation on how to register a new field agent, that subsequently will login to Enketo to submit data from a browser.

Visit the Field Agents section in the main menu:

Fill in the form with the credentials of the field agent.

![](/img/field_credentials.JPG)

---

Verify that the field agent has been successfully created in the list of registered field agents:

![](/img/registered_field.JPG)

---

In the project definition, select “Assign field agents”:

![](/img/assign_menu.JPG)

---

Select the field agent(s):

![](/img/assign.JPG)

---

Click on the “Add field agents” button and verify that the user has been assigned to the project.

---

In the main menu, visit the form you wish to fill out using the browser and click on the “Submit data from a browser” button to display the form:

![](/img/submit.JPG)

---

Now the form will be displayed and request the field agent credentials that were registered in the Library.

![](/img/credentials.JPG)


---

Once the credentials are provided, the form to be filled in will be displayed:

![](/img/form.JPG)

---

In the case of the Registration Form, you need to replace the QR code (used in ODK Collect) by a code that follows the pattern: projectownerusername-packagenumber-projectcode~

For example, if the project owner username is: ballen and the project code: prj01 and you assign the package #30 you should write as follows: ballen-30-prj01~

Remember to keep the ~ sign at the end so ClimMob can read the entire code.
