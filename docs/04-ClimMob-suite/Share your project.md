ClimMob allows you to collaborate by sharing your project with other users. When you invite someone, you must assign a role that defines what level of access they will have:

●	**Owner** – Automatically assigned to the person who created the project. Owners cannot be changed.

●	**Admin** – Full control of the project, including permission to share it with others.

●	**Editor** – Can modify any section of the project but cannot share it with new users.

●	**Member** – Read-only access. Members can view all information but cannot make changes.

How-to:

1.	Open the Project overview and go to the Share project section.

2.	Enter the email of the user you want to invite.

3.	Select the role (Admin, Editor, or Member) that best fits their level of participation.

4.	Confirm to share the project. The invited user will now have access according to the role you assigned.
