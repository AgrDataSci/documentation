### 14. Project overview

The Project overview is the starting point of any ClimMob project. It guides you through the essential steps required to set up, manage, and share your research trial. Each section builds on the previous one, ensuring that your project is well-structured and ready for implementation.

**Project profile:** define the basic details of your project. Here you set up the project title, description, objectives, and key identifiers that will allow others to understand its purpose at a glance.

**Assign field agents:** select the team members or collaborators who will collect data in the field. Assigning field agents ensures that responsibilities are clear, and data collection is organized.

**Assign technologies:** choose the agricultural technologies or practices that will be tested in your trial. These could include new crop varieties, fertilizers, or management techniques.

**Prepare participant registration form:** design the form that will be used to register farmers or participants in your project. This form collects key demographic and contextual information, making it possible to analyze results across different participant groups.

**Prepare trial data collection:** set up the data collection forms that participants or field agents will use during the trial. These forms capture observations, feedback, and results, ensuring standardized and comparable data.

**Trial documentation**: upload or create documentation related to your trial, such as protocols, manuals, or additional reference material. This helps maintain transparency and ensures that all collaborators follow the same procedures.

**Share project with other users:** Invite colleagues, partners, or stakeholders to view or collaborate on your project. Sharing increases transparency, improves teamwork, and allows for broader use of the collected data.
