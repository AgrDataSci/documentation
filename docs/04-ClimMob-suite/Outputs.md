### 16. Final report produced by ClimMob

After the analysis is completed, ClimMob automatically generates a final report summarizing the results of the on-farm trials. This report is designed to help project managers and researchers interpret the outcomes and make evidence-based decisions.

**Understanding the report**

The final report typically includes:

●	**Ranking of technologies**: performance of each technology as evaluated by participants.

●	**Comparison of variables**: results based on the variables selected during the analysis.

●	**Visual outputs**: tables and graphs that make it easier to interpret preferences and performance.

**Accessing the report**

1.	Go to the **Downloads** section of the ClimMob platform.

2.	Locate the file generated after your analysis.

3.	Open the document to review and share with your team or stakeholders.
