**Speeding up agricultural innovation through large-scale participatory experiments**

Under climate uncertainty, many farmers need to change their agricultural practices, adopt new crop varieties, switch to using different inputs, or apply new management strategies. But there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Triadic comparison of technology options (tricot) is a research methodology that helps farmers to identify the most suitable technologies for the local conditions of their farm. Tricot (read: ‘try-cot’) engages farmers as ‘farmer researchers’ in the testing or validation of new crop varieties and other promising technologies.
