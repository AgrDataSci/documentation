| ✔ | Step            | Task             | Key Actions                                                                                           | Responsible             |
|---|------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| ☐ | **1.Preparation** | Define scope     | Identify local problems; select technology options; determine evaluation criteria; decide target area & farmer numbers | Researchers + Implementers |
| ☐ |                | Prepare materials | Produce quality seed/inputs; prepare observation cards, brochures, and training materials             | Researchers             |
| ☐ | **2.Design**  | Create project in ClimMob | Register account; set up project using SOP; assign field agents; input technology options; revise data collection questions | Implementers            |
| ☐ |                | Randomization & packages | Generate trial packages with QR codes; label bags; prepare balanced sets                              | Implementers            |
| ☐ | **3.Recruitment** | Farmer selection | Identify volunteers (men/women, different ages & roles); ensure commitment                            | Field agents            |
| ☐ |                | Mobilization     | Outreach via meetings, posters, word of mouth                                                         | Field agents            |
| ☐ | **4.Distribution** | Training workshop | Train farmers in tricot method, trial setup, and observation cards                                    | Implementers + Field agents |
| ☐ |                | Distribute trial packages | Provide QR-coded packages with 3 options, observation card, and brochure                              | Field agents            |
| ☐ |                | Register farmers | Use ODK Collect to record farmer details and package code                                             | Field agents            |
| ☐ | **5.Execution** | On-farm trials   | Farmers plant/manage 3 plots side by side under normal practices                                      | Farmers                 |
| ☐ | **6.Observation** | Field evaluations | Farmers record “best” and “worst” for each criterion on observation cards                             | Farmers                 |
| ☐ |                | Follow-up        | Provide reminders/support via calls/visits; assist with card filling if needed                        | Field agents            |
| ☐ | **7.Compilation** | Collect data     | Field agents gather observation cards/data; input via ODK Collect; upload to ClimMob                  | Field agents            |
| ☐ | **8.Analysis** | Process data     | Use ClimMob to generate reports (technology rankings, explanatory variable analysis)                  | Implementers            |
| ☐ |                | Outputs          | Produce analysis report (researchers) + infosheets (farmers)                                          | Implementers            |
| ☐ | **9.Feedback** | Final workshops  | Share overall results; distribute infosheets; facilitate farmer group discussions                     | Implementers + Field agents |
| ☐ |                | Practical training | Provide additional agronomy lessons (e.g., seed storage)                                              | Implementers            |
| ☐ | **10.Evaluation** | Assess cycle     | Gather farmer + agent feedback; evaluate indicators (completion rate, gender ratio, adoption, repeat participation, diffusion) | Researchers + Implementers |
| ☐ |                | Plan next cycle  | Adjust technology pool (drop poor options, add new); expand farmer participation                      | All stakeholders        |
