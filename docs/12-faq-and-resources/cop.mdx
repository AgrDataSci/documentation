## What is the 1000FARMS Community of Practice

1000FARMS is a project that aims to implement an Africa-wide, digitally supported network for on-farm variety testing using tricot. The intended outcome is that breeding programs and partners can access critical performance data plus direct farmer feedback and use it to make better “what to advance/where to recommend” decisions. 

On-farm testing at scale is hard for predictable reasons: logistics, consistency, data quality, staff turnover, varying local realities, and the constant evolution of tools and methods. A Community of Practice helps turn those challenges into shared knowledge. The [1000FARMS Community of Practice](https://community.1000farms.net/) is therefore a place to find on-farm testing and tricot resources, connect with the community to share experiences and ask questions to 1000FARMS team members.

Anyone can become a member of the Community of Practice.

## What you’ll find inside the Communinty of Practice website

The site is organized like a modern forum (powered by Discourse), with categories that map to the real needs of practitioners:

**1000FARMS Webinars** – A library of webinar recordings. The category description emphasizes that webinars are archived with transcribed Q&A, and sometimes extra context is added—so learning doesn’t disappear after the live session ends.

**Community** – A default home for introductions, cross-topic questions, and connection-building. There’s even a dedicated “Introduce yourself” thread that nudges people to add avatars—small touches that help a network feel human.

**Announcements** – Where updates land: new ClimMob features, training courses, country activities, and other important information meant for everyone.

**Tricot / ClimMob Methods** – A space for the real nuts-and-bolts: trial methodology discussions, implementation questions, and open exchange on what to do in tricky scenarios.'
