# Trial feedback to farmers

> Anna Muller, Juan Manuel Londono

## Feedback to farmers

You have concluded your trial on ClimMob. Now the farmer-researchers are eager to know the results of their trials. All farmers are invited to a final workshop to receive and discuss the results. 

Farmers are the data producers of this citizen science approach and thus discussing the outcome of the trials is a crucial part of the tricot vision for partnership on the same level. Also, farmers have had different experiences with their trials, so reciprocal sharing of these experiences with other farmers is an important part of the learning process. Plan at least half a day for each feedback workshop.

We recommend that the workshop consists of the following parts (typical duration: **75–110 minutes**, excluding travel and set-up): 

1. **Welcome and purpose (Kick-off / introduction) — 5–10 min**
Gather and inform the farmer group about the nature of the gathering. You can find support in local leadership (lead farmers or field agents). 

2. **The concluded tricot trial — 5–10 min**
Briefly explain the objectives, process, and scope of the concluded trial. 

3. **Farmer Feedback Sheet handover and explanation — 20–25 min** 
The farmers receive their personal infosheets with the names of the technologies that they tested and which technology they preferred. They are given time to review the sheet and ask clarifying questions. 
4. **Discussion among farmers (small groups by preference) — 5–10 min (set-up) + 15–20 min (share-back)** 
Discussion among the farmers is important: everyone can learn from each other. It is recommended to form small groups for this activity (of about 5–7 people), including a facilitator (a field agent or experienced farmer). Groups can discuss why they chose their preferred technology and what stood out in the trial. Groups present their conclusions in a plenary session. 

5. **Overall results presentation (group-level results) — 10–15 min** 
The project implementers or the local field agents present the overall results of the technology evaluation using the farmer feedback sheet. Farmers learn which of these technologies performed best under which conditions. It is crucial to make it clear that there is no single best technology option. In fact, optimal technology options can differ across farms and farmers. 
If relevant, provide a short explanation of the Incomplete Block Design (IBD) and how it supports robust comparisons across many farmers. 

6. **Certificate handover — ~5 min** 
They get acknowledged for their work with the tricot certificate (see below). 

7. **Quick reflection (optional: NPS) — 5–10 min** 
Use a simple scale (0–10) to capture how useful farmers found the feedback sheet and session. This can support learning and improvement for future workshops. 

8. **Next steps and closing — ~5 min** 
Inform farmers about next steps in your engagement: What will the data be used for? How can farmers reach the project implementers? Are more trials planned? What will happen now in the technology development process? Answers to these questions treat farmers as meaningful partners on the same level. 

These points should be considered by the field agents: 

* Discussion among the farmers is important: everyone can learn from each other. 

* It is crucial to make it clear that there is no single best technology option. In fact, optimal technology options can differ across farms and farmers. 

* Field agents should also annotate feedback provided by the farmers on their experience with the trials and the project in general. 

### Feedback materials

[**Link to Farmer Feedback Documents**](/resources/resources#feedback)

#### The farmer feedback sheet – the main trial results

This sheet (available in the link above) was designed to present individual and group trial results to farmers in an easily understandable way. It is automatically generated by ClimMob when you request the analysis of your trial results. The sheet contains basic information about which varieties performed best for the farmer and the group. Print this sheet for every farmer in your trial. People that cannot attend the feedback session may still receive this via their neighbors.

#### The farmer certificate – an acknowledgement of the farmers’ contribution

This certificate (available in the link above) was designed to stress the importance of the farmers' contribution to the tricot trial. It is an acknowledgement of their role in the process. You can add the logo of your organization to the certificate. Print this for every farmer and sign.

### How to prepare feedback sessions

Budget: Plan resources (team time and money) for this final workshop from the start. Plan your team’s time to visit all communities or regions holding trial result workshops. Plan for your team’s time to debrief after the workshops and document learnings to integrate them in the planning of next trials. 

Group sizes: As with the training and distribution workshop, in most cases farmers should be limited to around 20–25 per event, in a central location accessible to all. 

Materials: depends highly on implementation of the sheet & diploma. We recommend using the feedback sheet and certificate available here.
