### Introduction

Trial documentation is a key step to ensure that your project records are complete and ready for analysis. This ClimMob feature allows you to keep track of all the essential aspects of your trial through a set of forms.

You can start filling out the forms at any moment during the project, beginning from its creation. Some forms are typically completed at the start, while others are filled in at the end. **Note: all forms must be completed before moving on to the Data Analysis step and downloading reports.**

How to fill out the forms

To provide maximum flexibility while maintaining standardized data, the forms include the following features:

*	Multi-select options: Most fields allow you to choose more than one answer. Look for the hint "Select all that apply" to document cases where multiple methods or criteria were used (e.g., combining different recruitment locations).
*	The "Other" category: If your specific method or resource is not listed in the dropdown menu, select "Other". This will open a dedicated text box for you to provide a custom description, ensuring every detail of your field operations is captured.
*	Non-applicable: If a specific question does not apply to your project's scope, you can select the "Non-applicable" option to proceed.

The Trial documentation section includes the following eight forms:

1.	Contributors
Document the organizations, researchers, or institutions involved in the project, including their roles and responsibilities. This helps acknowledge contributions and ensures transparency. 

**Note:** This form is exclusively for technical and operational contributors. Funding institutions or donors should not be listed here, as they have a dedicated section in the documentation.

When adding a collaborator, you must provide the following details:

*	Collaborator’s name: You can search for existing ClimMob users. If the person has a profile, their name will appear for selection. If they are not in the system, you can enter their full name, and the system will label them as an "external contributor."
*	Sector: Specify the professional or industrial sector to which the collaborator belongs.
*	Organization: Begin typing the affiliation. If it is already in our global database, select it from the list. If it’s a new institution, enter the full name, and ClimMob will add a "-new affiliation" tag to it. 
*	Role: You can select multiple roles for a single contributor. This field follows the DataCite Metadata Schema, ensuring that roles are standardized for global data citation.
*	Activities: Specify the specific tasks performed by the contributor. This selection is based on the CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy), which allows for a high-level of granularity in identifying specific contributions (e.g., Data curation, Investigation, Software, etc.).

2.	Funders

This new, dedicated section allows you to record the financial support behind your trial. Keeping accurate funding records is crucial for transparency, compliance with donor requirements, and institutional reporting.

If your project received external financial support, you can document multiple sources by providing the following details for each:

*	Funder name: Search for the name of the donor or institution providing the funds. The system includes a pre-populated list of global funding organizations for consistency.
*	Grant title: Enter the official name of the grant or project as specified in the funding agreement.
*	Grant number: Provide the unique identification code or reference number assigned by the funder to this specific grant.
**Note:** If your research is supported by multiple donors, use the "+ Add other" button to create a separate entry for each funding source.

3.	Experimental design

This form consolidates the technical structure of the trial with its strategic alignment. It allows you to document everything from the physical layout of the plots to the specific market targets the research aims to address.

In this form, you will need to specify:

*	Plot size: Indicate if a standard plot size was used across the trial. If so, provide the area in square meters (m2).
*	Design remarks: A space to document any specific observations or notes regarding the physical plot design.
*	Experimental design: Select the statistical or methodological designs applied in the trial (e.g., incomplete blocks, randomized designs, etc.).
*	Special features: Describe any unique elements, such as innovative methodologies, advanced technology usage, or specific environmental conditions that influenced the trial’s execution.
*	Market segments: Identify the specific market segments associated with the project. These options are synchronized with the Global Market Intelligence Platform (GloMIP) (https://glomip.cgiar.org/).
*	Target product profile (TPP) IDs: Associate the project with specific TPP IDs from the GloMIP platform. This ensures that the trial results are directly linked to standardized global breeding goals and product requirements.

4.	Genotypes

This section provides a detailed technical profile of the technologies being tested. To save time and ensure consistency, ClimMob automatically lists the genotypes you included during the project setup.

Your task in this form is to review the automatically generated list and complete the descriptive fields. While this information is used for documentation and metadata purposes—and does not affect the statistical results of the trial—it is vital for the long-term interpretation of the data.

For each genotype, you should provide:

*	Genotype name: The original name as registered in the project.
*	Final genotype name: Use this field if you need to standardize the name for final reporting or publication.
*	Entry type: Classify the material (e.g., historical check, farmer check, commercial check, evaluation entry, release candidate, etc.).

Table 1. Entry type options used in on-farm or breeding trials and their descriptions.

| Entry type option     | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| Historical check      | A variety that was widely used in the past but is no longer the primary choice. Used to measure genetic gain over time. |
| Farmer check          | The local variety or material currently managed and preferred by the farmers in the trial area. Essential for calculating "win rates." |
| Commercial check      | A leading variety currently available in the local market. Used to compare the performance of new materials against the best current commercial options. |
| Comparative check     | A specific entry used as a benchmark for certain traits (e.g., a known drought-tolerant variety used to compare new drought-tolerant lines). |
| Evaluation entry      | The primary experimental material, line, or technology being tested in the trial for potential adoption or further breeding. |
| Release candidate     | An advanced line that has shown superior performance and is in the final stages of the official regulatory process for commercial release. |
| Replacement candidate | A specific material intended to replace an existing variety that has become susceptible to pests, diseases, or changing climate conditions. |

*	Release year: If applicable, the year the variety was officially released.
*	Crossing year: The year the specific cross was made (for breeding lines).
*	Origin: The geographic or institutional source of the genetic material.
*	Target traits: Specify the key characteristics being evaluated (e.g., drought tolerance, pest resistance, yield).
