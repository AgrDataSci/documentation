### Trial Documentation

Trial documentation is always done in ClimMob. It is a key step to ensure that your project records are complete and ready for analysis. This feature allows you to keep track of all the essential aspects of your trial through a set of forms.

You can start filling out the documentation forms at any moment during the project, beginning from its creation. Some forms are typically completed at the start, while others are filled in at the end. **NB: all forms must be completed before moving on to the Data Analysis step and downloading reports.**
