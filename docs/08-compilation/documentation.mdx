### Trial Documentation

Trial documentation is always done in ClimMob. It is a key step to ensure that your project records are complete and ready for analysis. This feature allows you to keep track of all the essential aspects of your trial through a set of forms.

You can start filling out the documentation forms at any moment during the project, beginning from its creation. Some forms are typically completed at the start, while others are filled in at the end. **NB: all forms must be completed before moving on to the Data Analysis step and downloading reports.**

### 13. Trial Documentation (to be replaced)

Trial documentation is a key step to ensure that your project records are complete and ready for analysis. This feature allows you to keep track of all the essential aspects of your trial through a set of forms.

You can start filling out the forms at any moment during the project, beginning from its creation. Some forms are typically completed at the start, while others are filled in at the end. **NB: all forms must be completed before moving on to the Data Analysis step and downloading reports.**

The Trial documentation section includes the following eight forms:

1. Contributors

Document the organizations, researchers, or institutions involved in the project, including their roles and responsibilities. This helps acknowledge contributions and ensures transparency.

2. Project design

Describe the structure of the trial: experimental design, partners who contribute with the trial, describe any special features of the trial and select the target environment of the trial. Environmental options come from the agroecological zones utilized on Global Market Intelligents Platform (GloMip) https://glomip.cgiar.org/market-segments.

3. Market segment 

Identify the market segment to which the project is associated. For consistency, the classification should follow the categories defined in the GloMip platform. https://glomip.cgiar.org/market-segments.

4. Participants 

Record how the sample size was calculated and how participants were selected.

When describing selection criteria, consider aspects such as:

* Prior studies: whether participants were chosen based on their inclusion in existing surveys, experiments.

* Datasets: whether participants were chosen based on their inclusion in community records.

* Knowledge and skills: if participants were selected due to their farming expertise, familiarity with certain crops, or ability to manage trials effectively.

* Gender: whether the project aimed for gender balance, targeted women or men specifically, or followed a quota system.

* Experience with the analyzed crop: how participants’ familiarity with the crop under evaluation influenced their inclusion in the trial.

* Household selection based on survey data: whether socioeconomic conditions, landholding size, or family composition played a role in participant selection.

For recruitment strategies, specify whether participants were:

* Open recruitment through public announcements, posters, or radio messages.

* Invited through their organizations, such as cooperatives, farmer associations, or NGOs.

When reporting recruitment locations, describe the physical or social spaces where participants were engaged—such as community centers, marketplaces, cooperative meetings, or local government facilities.

Finally, detail how informed consent was obtained. This could include:

* Verbal consent, documented by facilitators during recruitment.

* Individual signed forms, providing a written record of participation.

* Community-level authorization, where a recognized leader or representative grants approval on behalf of a group.

In all cases, the option “Other” is always available, allowing you to enter a description when the predefined choices do not fit.

5. Tricot training

Capture details of the training sessions provided to participants. Indicate who facilitated the sessions and how tricot methodology was explained.

Specify, on what instructions were given regarding the trial:

* Agronomic management – guidance on crop care practices such as planting density, irrigation, weeding, or pest management.

* Trial setup – instructions on how to establish the tricot trial, including plot arrangement, randomization of varieties, and labeling.

* Food preparation methods – in cases where evaluation involves sensory testing, training on standardized preparation and cooking methods.

* Other – any additional type of instruction not captured above.

Note whether the training was conducted:

* Individually – one-on-one training with each participant.

* In groups – collective sessions with multiple participants at the same time.

* Other – any alternative training format.

Describe follow-up procedures to ensure compliance and timely data collection, such as additional visits, reminder calls, or digital monitoring.

Also specify any additional inputs provided to participants, for example:

* Fertilizers – chemical or organic fertilizers distributed as part of the trial.

* Agrochemicals – pesticides, fungicides, or herbicides supplied to participants.

* Other – any other input provided that does not fit the listed categories.

6. Data collection

Describe the methods used for data collection, such as phone calls, farm visits, or lead farmer interviews. Indicate the tools applied in the process, including ODK Collect, Enketo, or Excel sheets.

7. Results communication

Document how trial results were shared with participants. Options may include group meetings, information sheets, individual visits, or other relevant formats.

8. Varieties

Provide details about the varieties or technologies tested in the trial. This includes the genotype name, the type of entry (historical check, farmer check, commercial check, comparative check, evaluation entry, release candidate, or replacement candidate), and the target traits under evaluation (e.g., drought tolerance, pest or disease resistance, product quality, yield, or other traits as specified).
