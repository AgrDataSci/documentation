### Prepare participant registration form in ClimMob

In this section, you can add and manage the administrative questions that field agents will ask participants during registration at the start of the project. These questions are important for two main reasons:

*	Administrative purposes: to keep a clear record of who is participating, where they live, and other key details that help organize and monitor the trial.

*	Data analysis purposes: to allow deeper insights, for example, checking whether younger participants adopt a technology faster, or whether female participants show a preference for certain options.

Once you have defined the list of questions, they will be available through the ODK Collect app. Field agents can then enter participant information directly into the app during registration.

How-to in ClimMob:

1.	On the project definition section, click Prepare participant registration form.

2.	Drag the questions you want to include from the left panel (available questions from the library) into the middle panel (assessment form). A preview of the selected questions will appear on the right panel (preview)—scroll down to see all of them.

3.	If the question you want is not available in the library, click Add new question and create it under the most relevant section.

4.	The ClimMob library already includes a list of commonly used questions, which you can easily add to the registration form.

### Register participants and distribute packages

Once you have prepared the packages with the different technology options [(see how to do that here)](/distribution/packages#prepare-test-packages), it is time to go to the field to distribute them and register each participant with their corresponding trial package.

How-to:

There are different ways to do this: you can arrange a meeting with all participants or visit them individually at their location.

**Using ODK Collect**

At a minimum, these basic data are required: 
* Trial package QR code
* Name of the tester (participating farmer)

The trial package code uses an QR code generated by ClimMob as a unique package ID throughout the trial. The QR Code is generated once the technologies are defined and the randomization is set up. The project implementer prints the codes (available in the Downloads section) and pastes it into each package. **Note: farmers should keep their package (QR) code for the duration of the project.**

1. Open ODK Collect and get the blank registration form.

2. Fill in the form with participant data. The first step is to scan the QR code attached to the package with the three technology options the participant is receiving. This links the package to their individual profile.

3. Once the forms are completed, send them to the server.

**Paper** (NOT RECOMMENDED, as it takes significantly more time and is more prone to errors):

1. Alternatively, you can register participants using paper forms. These are available under Downloads → Printer-friendly registration form.

2. Enter the data into an Excel file. On the main menu (left side), click on Upload data (green button) → Create template. The template will be generated and available in Downloads → Excel template for uploading registration form data.

3. Once you have filled in the template, go back to the main menu, click on Upload data (green button, left side), and upload the Excel document.

Review, edit and complete registration:

* Click on the green button View data to review the submitted data and edit if necessary.

* Click on the red button, Finish registration once you have registered all participants.

⚠️ Please note: This step cannot be undone, so only proceed when you are certain that registration is complete.
