# R-Instat for Tricot On-Farm Testing Analysis

## Overview

R-Instat is an accessible, user-friendly free software specifically designed for statistical analysis in agricultural science. In the context of tricot, R-Instat serves as a practical analytical tool that simplifies and streamlines the complex data workflows typical of Tricot trials. This integration enhances data-driven, farmer-led insights in on-farm testing.

## Purpose and Key Features

Accessibility: R‑Instat provides a graphical interface to R’s powerful analytical capabilities, making statistical analysis approachable for practitioners and educators who may not be familiar with coding.

Tricot Suitability: Tricot experiments generate ranking data and farmer‑provided assessments across heterogeneous environments. R‑Instat enables efficient processing of such data, including ranking calculations and visual summaries.

Educational Integration: IDEMS International’s eCampus includes workshops—such as “KMD R‑Instat Workshop 2022” and “Tricot Workshop”—that embed R‑Instat training within broader curricula focused on participatory on‑farm trial analysis.

## Benefits of Using R-Instat in Tricot Analysis

User-Friendly Interface: Eliminates the barrier of coding, enabling agronomists, researchers, and educators to focus on interpretation rather than syntax.

Streamlined Workflow: From data cleaning to ranking and visualization, R-Instat centralizes tasks common in Tricot analysis.

Capacity Building: Facilitates training through structured modules and workshops, democratizing access to participatory data analytics.

Scalability: Supports high-volume, decentralized data workflows typical of large-scale Tricot deployments.

| **Design**          | Farmers implement Tricot trials using a randomized incomplete‑block design (three options per block) ([PMC][1]).                   | Not directly used here but foundational to downstream analysis.                |
| **Data Collection** | Farmers collect rankings and trait observations from each plot.                                                                    | Data formatted and cleaned within R-Instat’s interface.                        |
| **Analysis**        | Use R-Instat to perform ranking analyses (e.g., worth estimates, Plackett-Luce models), visualize results, and generate summaries. | Empowers stakeholders to interpret varietal performance across environments.   |
| **Reporting**       | Generate accessible reports that integrate farmer feedback and statistical insights.                                               | Supports the creation of visual and textual outputs for broader dissemination. |
