### **Understanding the report**

The final report typically includes:

1. Ranking of technologies: performance of each technology as evaluated by participants.

2. Comparison of variables: results based on the variables selected during the analysis.

3. Visual outputs: tables and graphs that make it easier to interpret preferences and performance.
