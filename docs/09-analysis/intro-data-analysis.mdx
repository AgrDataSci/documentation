# Statistical models applied to tricot data

> Kauê de Sousa, Joost van Heerwaarden, Hugo Dorado

## Introduction

The tricot data consist primarily of rankings provided by farmers, but can also include numeric and continuous measurements such as yield, plant density, disease incidence, or days to maturity. Because the core of tricot relies on comparative evaluation, statistical models that work naturally with relative rather than absolute performance are required.
For ranking data, tricot analyses rely primarily on the Plackett–Luce (PL) model [@luce1959; @plackett1975]. This probabilistic model, derived from Luce's Choice Axiom, estimates the probability that an item (e.g. a crop variety) is preferred over others within a set. Each item is assigned a latent parameter often referred to as its "worth" or ability, which reflects its expected performance relative to alternatives.

The PL model has been widely used in fields where choices are made from sets of alternatives, including sports rankings, comparative judgement exercises [@Donovan2025; @Chambers2022], consumer preference studies [@Olaosebikan2023], and crop variety selection [@vanEtten2019]. Ranking methods in revealed-choice experiments are rapid, locally adaptable, and cognitively intuitive for respondents, requiring little calibration or training [@Coe2002]. This makes them particularly well suited for decentralized, farmer-led experimentation at scale.

In tricot, farmers typically compare three varieties per trait in an incomplete block design. The PL model is especially appropriate for this structure, as it accommodates partial rankings and comparisons among subsets of all tested varieties. This allows the aggregation of thousands of small, farmer-managed trials into a single coherent statistical analysis.

In the Plackett–Luce (PL) model, each variety \( i \) is associated with a positive worth parameter \( \pi_i \). The probability that variety \( i \) is ranked above variety \( j \) depends on the ratio of their worths:

\[
P(i \succ j) = \frac{\pi_i}{\pi_i + \pi_j}
\]

For a full ranking of multiple items, the model expresses the probability of observing a specific order as a product of conditional choice probabilities. In the tricot context, this means that each farmer's ranking contributes information about relative performance, even though each farmer only evaluates a small subset of varieties.

Key advantages of the PL framework for tricot include:
- Ability to handle incomplete and unbalanced designs
- Direct modeling of ordinal (ranking) data
- Straightforward interpretation of relative performance
- Compatibility with covariates and hierarchical extensions

The estimated worth parameters can be transformed into probabilities of outperforming other varieties or into expected ranks, which are highly intuitive for breeders, extension agents, and decision makers.

## Modelling heterogeneity using covariates and recursive partitioning

Farmer evaluations are influenced by environmental conditions, management practices, and socio-economic context. To account for this heterogeneity, the PL model can be extended with covariates. One widely used approach in tricot is model-based recursive partitioning [@Strobl2011]. This method identifies subgroups in the data using binary splits based on environmental or socio-economic variables (e.g. rainfall, temperature, soil type, gender of farmer). Within each subgroup, a separate PL model is estimated. The result is a Plackett–Luce tree, which reveals how variety performance changes across contexts and helps define Target Populations of Environments (TPEs). This approach has proven especially useful for identifying genotype × environment (G×E) interactions under real farm conditions, supporting context-specific variety recommendations [@vanEtten2019].

More recently, developments in Plackett–Luce regression allow the inclusion of linear covariates directly in the model [@Turner2020; @Alamu2023; @Kang2025]. This enables:

- Modelling of environmental gradients rather than discrete groups
- Inclusion of variety-level covariates (e.g. traits, genomic predictions)
- More continuous representations of performance variation across environments

These advances bring tricot analysis closer to mainstream quantitative genetics and breeding analytics.

## Analysing continous data

Although rankings are central in tricot, many trials also collect quantitative measurements such as yield or disease scores [@Nabateregga2025]. These data are typically analysed using linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) or generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs).

Mixed models allow partitioning of variation into components attributable to:

- Variety (genotype)
- Environment
- Farmer or location
- Residual error

They also support estimation of heritability, variance components, and genotype × environment interactions. When tricot trials include both ranking and quantitative data, analyses can be conducted in parallel and later integrated at the interpretation stage. Research is ongoing into joint modelling frameworks that combine ordinal and continuous data within a single statistical structure [@Dorado2026].

## Linking tricot with climate and environmental data

A major innovation in tricot analysis has been the integration of seasonal climate data, and other spatial covariates. Van Etten et al. (2019) [@vanEtten2019] demonstrated how PL models combined with climate covariates and cross-validation can produce locally specific variety recommendations. This approach allows:

- Identification of environmental drivers of variety performance
- Prediction of performance in new locations
- Development of climate-informed decision support tools

This integration is especially important under increasing climate variability, where static recommendations are insufficient.

## Data synthesis across trials

Another major development is the rank-based synthesis of data across multiple trials [@Brown2020]. Because the PL model works with relative performance, it allows the combination of datasets from different years, locations, and experimental conditions—even when absolute measurements are not comparable. This is particularly promising for tricot, as it enables:

- Meta-analysis of decentralized trials
- Increased statistical power through aggregation
- Reuse of legacy or small-scale datasets
- Standardized data formats and open data sharing will further increase the value of such synthesis efforts, creating cumulative knowledge across projects and regions.
- Integration of genomic and biological information

In an important extension of the PL framework, de Sousa et al. (2021) [@deSousa2021] incorporated genomic relatedness among varieties as a covariance structure within the model. This increased predictive accuracy, demonstrating that combining farmer evaluations with genomic information can improve selection decisions. This approach opens the door to:

- Decentralized genomic selection
- Testing genetically diverse materials under farmer management
- Better representation of G×E interactions in breeding pipelines

Such methods help bridge participatory research and advanced quantitative genetics.
