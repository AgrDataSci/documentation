### Get familiar with ClimMob 

When users log into ClimMob for the first time, they are welcomed with a guided setup designed to help them configure the platform before creating their first project. This workflow ensures that key components are defined early, streamlining future project setup.

### Navigate the main menu

The main menu is located on the left side of the screen and gives access to key areas of the platform, including your projects, library items, and tools.

Here is the order in which these onboarding messages appear:

#### Libraries

Libraries are centralized repositories for elements that will be reused in multiple projects, such as agents, technologies, and questions.

●	Field agents: are the individuals responsible for registering farmers and collecting data in the field. You’ll define them once and assign them across multiple projects.

●	Technologies: are the options that farmers will evaluate—for example, different seed varieties, soil treatments, or planting methods. These are stored in the library for future use.

●	Questions: ClimMob provides a rich library of premade evaluation questions developed by the 1000FARMS team, available in multiple languages and ready to use across projects. This library helps ensure consistency and comparability in data collection. In addition, you can also define your own custom questions—such as “Which variety grew fastest?” or “Which option tasted better?”—which will then be stored and reused in future projects.

#### Downloads 

This menu option gives access to tools and resources needed for field implementation, including:

●	Field data collection templates

●	Survey forms

●	ClimMob documentation

●	R analysis tools
