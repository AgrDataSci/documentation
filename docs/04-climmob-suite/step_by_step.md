## Data Analysis

The analysis will give you an automated report with useful results, such as:

• Description of the methodological approach applied

• A rating of how well each technology performed for each pre-defined criterion 

• Information on differing performances (if any) depending on explanatory variables (e.g. the highest yielding crop variety with or without irrigation; or the variety preferred by women, variety preferred by men)

• A rating of how all pre-defined characteristics were correlated with the overall performance. This is useful to assess which characteristic influenced the overall appreciation of the technologies tested. 

The analysis is conducted in six simple steps:

1. Select the project you will analyze.

2. Press the button ‘Select variables to analyze’ in the main menu of ClimMob. 

3. Select the explanatory variables you want to include. Explanatory variables can lead to a better understanding of different observations about the tested technologies, and to more useful results. For example, one crop variety may perform best under irrigation, but in drought conditions, a different variety may give best results.

4. Select the documents you want to generate. 

Two types of outputs are possible: 

• Analysis report 
This is for the implementing organization and the researchers. It is a report presenting all results: it tells you which technologies performed best for every tested criterion, and whether there are any differences due to explanatory variables, for example gender, age, irrigation.

• Infosheets 
This is a document that contains a personal information sheet for each participating farmer. These infosheets contain: 

• The names of their three specific tested technology options

• The farmer´s own answers

• The most recommended technology options for the farmer’s own farm. 

5. Press OK. 

Depending on the number of farmers, the analysis can take a long time. In some cases, it may take up to half an hour to generate all of the infosheets. You can obtain the infosheets and reports from the Downloads section.
