# Example of Experimental Design: Bean Trial Protocol

## Introduction

This document provides a standardised overview of the basic information
that will be collected during a bean tricot trial. Further traits and
variables can be added, but this will need to be done by the project
manager in ClimMob.

The protocol indicates the data collection moments during
the trials and the variables and traits collected at each data
collection moment. Farmers evaluate varieties in their on-farm trials
and provide comparative observations by ranking the varieties based on
their performance throughout their growth and post-harvest qualities
including taste and consumption preferences.

A separate protocol for bean consumer analysis will be developed to
understand taste and preferences of non-tricot farmer consumers to
strengthen inclusive and informed breeding decisions.

A more in-depth overview of the steps required for developing an on-farm
trial project using [tricot and ClimMob](https://climmob.net/) is
available here:

## Data collection moments and traits to be collected 

Table 1 outlines the data collection moments, time intervals of data
collection and traits to be collected during the bean tricot trial.
