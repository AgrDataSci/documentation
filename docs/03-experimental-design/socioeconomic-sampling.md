Expertise and social inclusiveness. A guide to choose participants for on-farm testing with the tricot approach.  

## Assuring experienced participants

A common weakness in standard participatory variety selections is that farmers are chosen without eye for their experience and the specific work they are doing and to which local social category they belong. Where this is considered usually very broad general categories are used such as age and sex., occupation, leve of education, farm size. Furthermore, when gender is brought in focus, the practice is mainly on having both men and women farmers in equal numbers evaluating the trials, disregarding their specific expertise or experience in farming. Another problem is that often farmers get chosen who feel comfortable talking and interacting within the sphere of a scientific evaluation, which emphasizes experience in reasoning and talking. This often excludes very skilled persons that however are not able or are normatively not allowed to communicate these skills and knowledge through language. But even if the respondent is good at talking it still does not include the tacit knowledge, the embodied skill and knowledge that people have. Breeders are however interested in detailed concrete hands-on information if they want to align with a demand led breeding approach such as the stage gate breeding approach that is now introduced in the CGIAR public sector breeding. Within the current reform to a stage gate breeding approach it is also crucial to get feedback from not only farmers but also processors/prepares and marketers who turn the RTB crop into an edible quality food product.

To overcome these issues while choosing the TRICOT participants, we therefore work with a so-called purposive sampling using a task group approach with an explicit gender dimension. This gender dimension is not only important within the light of gender equity but is also very practical and concrete if we want to know the expertise and experience people have with regards to work related to the RTB corps because often tasks related to the RTB crop are gendered: certain tasks are often carried out be a specific sex. Important to note here is that a task group is not necessarily a group that works together but a category of people of the same social segment that carry out similar tasks related to the crop.

A task group approach is also in line with a much more performative way of participation instead of only a deliberative one (Richards, 2007) . In such a performative approach people who are verbally not strong or are not allowed to speak up are included and approached more self-evidently and tacitly, because they have been identified as a specific task group within a locally defined and thus relevant social group or intersection of different groups.

From a demand led perspective breeders are interested in good information on the suitability of improved varieties within the livelihoods of the users and therefore want to know the user preferred crop characteristics. To get good information it is therefore important to get this from experienced people that are skilled in farming but also with regards to processing of the crop into the food products and their quality as well as the marketing of the crop. Importantly storability of food products as well as fresh roots tubers and bananas are important in the last instance.  E.g if men are are hardly involved into processing cassava into gari , a breeder will not be interested much in men’s preferences with relation to processing because they will not always be able to give correct hands on experience-based knowledge because they do not possess the skill. Men in this case might have indirect knowledge about it (e.g. through their spouses), but certainly not the embodied skills.

A bad example of how participants got chosen is a farce case where someone wanted to work with mango farmers and ended up with only male participants of which none had a mango tree field. When later confronting these participants with this, the village chief and his friends all claimed to have a mango tree in their backyard. It is obvious that a tricot with such participants will not yield the best information.

A task group approach and gender
Sex-disaggregated data collection protocols on variety preferences are problematic as they put upfront sex and gender differences as an explanatory factor.  From a political and ethical perspective this approach is also guilty of up-front discrimination based on sex difference.  This type of data also renders invisible how gender roles are shaped by the intersections of locally defined identities, such as occupational tasks, immigrant or ‘local’, ethnic/language group, age group and economic status. So instead of initially segregating by sex groups we propose an identification of task groups. Simply: Who does what within each of the locally defined social categories. 
This task group approach can capture the intersectionality of local identities by focusing on who does what along the value chain and allows for a closer integration with practices related to participatory trials, post-harvest processing evaluation, food processing and marketing as these connect to specific tasks and thus specific crop characteristics/traits. Identifying who does what in each of the social groups in the community can accurately and concretely tap into the knowledge, skills and working conditions of these groups without referring to gender as a subject, but with the work that different often highly gendered task groups do, as subject. 
Taking the task and the work  as central entry points avoids the highly political aspects that come into view when explicitly addressing sex and gender. By continuously referring to the work and working conditions related to a specific crop or set of crops, one can much more neutrally gain knowledge about how gendered certain task are, and learn about the constraints and opportunities and preferences of the different task groups. And this is something breeders are interested in if they want to see an increase of adoption of their varieties.  In addition, by valuing and showing interest in the work done by different groups one triggers senses of proud and belonging and it facilitates more politically neutral and realistic conversations and cooperation based on the, organization and technicalities of the work and the working conditions and how this work can be done better in the current context. Knorr-Cetina (1999)  would call this; building epistemic cultures based on fascination and content of the work.  This method communicates focused skilled practice instead of emotion and values as abstract themes. 
Therefore, task group based PVS trials and participatory processing evaluation exercises as well as participatory breeding events are perfect social science tools to achieve such a more performative and tacit cooperation based on technological practices and their organization. Such PVS exercises can be done with merchants as a group, the growers as a group as well as processors. Consulting people who are involved in more than one of these activities are an opportunity to catch more task groups at once. And it is this opportunity that we will have to use because choosing someone as a TRICOT participant, assumes that such a person is farming the crop. In many cases however the person does a lot of more tasks related to the crop.
People can simultaneously belong to different task groups and the extent to which they belong to one and not another and the extent to which certain tasks are done by women and men are informative about gender roles and norms and current possibilities and developments within farming, processing and selling. 

How to practically use a task group approach?

After applying a representative sampling frame for your region: having a certain amount of communities per state or district in the entire area of focus (there where the crop is commonly grown) and after having consulted e.g. government bodies at different geographical levels to identify active regions where the crop is cultivated, it now comes down to identifying participants within communities on ground.

For this a task group approach distinguishes the following practical stages to follow at village community level:

1.	Identify which crop and which tasks around that crop exist: whose experience and skills and work are of interest to us? e.g. Are people who have experience in cultivation as well as processing relevant to the study? This is useful if you want to practically and directly relate the relative importance of agronomic, processing and food quality characteristics. Usually a breeder should be interested in skills/expertise in all the work related to the crop because it can reveal crucial traits within the value chain that are needed to assure adoption of a variety. This will help the breeder in determining the key traits necessary.

2.	Identify how a community itself defines its different social groups. This can be done through meetings with village heads and discussions with key informants, transect walks and interviews with several people carrying out the work around the crop under study. This also involves making the TRICOT’s  scientific inquiry explicit among the leading elite and key informants in the community so that they clearly understand that you want to include respondents/participants from all social groups, also the disadvantaged and the less better off, and explicitly try to avoid leadership effect (e.g. Humphreys et al 2006)  and state that the village leading elite is not to determine only who participates: cultivate a democratic and equity focused discussion and debate on studying experienced based crop related expertise that exist among the different social groups. Table 1 can help here in mapping the community. 

3.	Within each locally defined and thus relevant social category, identify ‘Who does what’ in relation to the production, processing and sale of the crop and its food products and identify respondents/participants representing the task or combinations of tasks that you are interested in (crop dependent) without using sex as initial criteria of selection. This should be done by verification that the respondent/participant indeed has detailed knowledge on the tasks that she or he has indicated to master: probe with work related jargon and discuss detailed practices related to each skill. N.B.: Make sure you have detailed knowledge of these practices on board in your field team to make good verification possible. The field team should therefore include breeder, anthropological, socio-economic and food science expertise. Food science is particularly important for the verification of the participants skills and obviously because quality food products and their relation to different varieties can be crucial for adoption.

4.	Include participants from each social group if applicable (e.g if Fulani herdsmen do not cultivate or process the RTB crop it would not make sense to include them as participant).

5.	Determine how you organize participants. For cassava in Nigeria we identified one lead farmer per 10 participants and 10 participants per community for whom the data collections is managed by the lead farmer that has or does not have a TRICOT trial her/himself. The 10 participants were representative of the community and included all important local social groups. It was important to build on local authority and respect: the group of 10 farmers chose their own representative!  This was found very important to assure providing ownership of the activity to the participants. One could also choose an agricultural extension officer to lead the farmer group, but this can only be done and will only give good data if these officers are respected and almost part of the community, which is often not the case (and it was not the case in most the communities visited in Nigeria).  Important to note here is that we chose for a group dynamic (of 10-11 persons in each community, depending on if the lead farmer also was a TRICOT participant or not) to stimulate the sense of belonging to the project as a group member. One could choose individual farmers even far from each other that will each independently communicate the information to you. Theoretically, from a positivistic sampling position, this might seem more appropriate, but we argue that the performative aspect of sharing the same project with a group creates a spirit of dedication essential in a crowdsourcing approach. It also facilitates better reporting back of information to the farmers: they become a community of colleagues rather than mere sole participants. 

*N.B. Remember that trial visits and research station staff costs should be reduced to a minimum, so it is very important to invest in choosing and building the right reliable local management unit and this works best using local respected persons and authorities.*

6.	Determine an appropriate mode of compensation to the participants. We compensated through the lead farmer and then followed up with the participants if they received their payment from the lead farmer. Payment was done through bank transfer. In case leadfarmer with bank accounts cannot be found another system of payment has to be thought of, like paying out during the lead farmer training. A modest sum for the work of the lead farmer moving between participants fields was arranged. The amounts should be low as  to assure participants motivation for the project and not just to hang in for the monetary benefits, but it should however be that substantial to motivate participants and make them feel that they  are not doing it all for the sake of the research project. These amounts have all to be locally determined based on the context. The agreement should be clearly stated in the agreement made with the lead farmer and signed to avoid disputes.

Table 1. Example of local social groups based on interaction with a village community in the Southwest of Nigeria focusing on cassava. Apparently ‘ethnic group’ was found important to distinguish different people. The groups highlighted in grey are the groups included among the TRICOT participants as the others are not involved in cassava work.
