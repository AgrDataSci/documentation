# Standard operating procedure

> Marie-Ang√©lique Laporte, Almendra Cremaschi

A crop protocol provides a standardised overview of the basic information that will be collected during a crop tricot trial. The protocol provides an overview of the data collection moments during the trials and the variables and traits collected at each data collection moment. Farmers evaluate varieties in their on-farm trials and provide comparative observations by ranking the varieties based on their performance throughout their growth and post-harvest qualities including taste and consumption preferences.
