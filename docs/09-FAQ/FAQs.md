# Frequently asked questions

## What is the incentive for growers to participate?

Through participation in a tricot experiment, growers are exposed to new technologies: For example, they may try out new crop varieties directly under the conditions of their own farm. This way, participating growers can learn about new options to improve their farming and might discover useful innovation under realistic conditions. Many growers are also motivated by being part of a research project, interacting with researchers and contributing to knowledge generation.

Even when a grower does not immediately identify a suitable option among the three tested technologies, participation can be useful: growers often discuss results with their neighbors, exchange seeds, and subsequently try out options that were successful on other participantsâ€™ farms.

## Can I merge data from two different tricot projects?

You can merge the data if both projects are testing the same technology and you have at least one technology option (e.g. the same crop variety) in both projects. The merger can be done, for example, in the R package using ClimMob R Tools and your API key. You find your API key in the ClimMob software, by clicking on your name >>> Profile.

## Does the ODK Collect app work on iOS smartphones?

As of today, there is no ODK Collect app for iOS. You need an Android phone to run ODK Collect.
