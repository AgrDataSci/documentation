## Budgeting

### Costing a tricot trial

Preparing the budget for a tricot trial requires consideration of many technical aspects, from seed multiplication to farmer training. To facilitate this, a standardized costing tool has been developed that will help users plan the budget of implementing a tricot trial for a specific crop. It ensures cost transparency and consistency across projects, allowing for cross-country comparisons. It also helps in distributing resources, identifying high-cost centers, and noting unnecessary additional expenses. Breeding programs will employ the tool for calculating the cost of implementing tricot trials for specific crops, thereby providing estimates that enhance the planning and efficiency of future tricot trials. 

Two costing tool templates have been developed that can be filled in and saved - one for grain crops and one for root, tuber and banana crops.

The costing tool (guidelines and costing templates) are found in the Resources section of this document [link here](/faq-and-resources/tricot-resources#costing).
