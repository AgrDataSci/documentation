## Farmer training workshop

The tricot process starts with a training and distribution workshop. Here, the farmers receive their trial packages and learn about the tricot methodology and data collection process.

### Organization and logistics

The training and distribution workshop should take place about four weeks before the start of the trial, so that farmers can adapt their own  farm planning. It is most effective to invite a maximum of 20 farmers at a time to the workshop. Women and men should be invited in equal numbers, if possible.

The project implementers, together with the local field agents, should invite interested farmers to a central location. This can be a village meeting hall or an NGO office. They should explain the tricot trial, its purpose, its benefits, and the responsibilities the farmers have. It is important to visualize what a tricot trial looks like, so farmers can see what is expected of them. If possible, you can develop a demonstration trial nearby beforehand. Otherwise, the trials can be visualized with a video. A small pictorial guide for farmers on tricot should also be handed out at the training workshop. See this is and [other supporting material for communication with farmers here](./faq-and resources/resources.mdx#support_material).

At the workshop, farmers are also trained on how to fill out the observation cards. Every farmer receives one observation card for the immediate exercise. It is important to fully explain the design of the card and go through filling out the card to allow the farmers to practice and gain familiarity with the process. Farmers will then be advised on how data will be collected, and whether a project implementer will be calling them or visiting them in person. 

Required workshop material and logistics: 
* A meeting place for at least 20 people
* Snacks
* Trial packages [(see next section here)](/distribution/packages#every-trial-package-should-contain-the-following-four-elements)
