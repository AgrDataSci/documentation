### Prepare test packages

Once your technologies have been randomized, the next step is to create the physical packages that participants will use for the blind testing.

How-to (three steps):

1. Gather materials

* Collect enough of each technology option that you are testing.

* Example: If you are testing seed varieties, gather sufficient quantities of each seed type.

2. Download package lists from ClimMob (in the Downloads section):

* Randomized trial packages list → shows which combination of three technology options goes into each package.

* Package list with QR codes for participant registration → contains the package number and its unique QR code.

3. Prepare and label the packages

* Assemble each package with its assigned set of three technology options.

* Cut out the corresponding label (from the package list with QR codes).

* Stick the label with the package number and QR code on the package before distributing it to participants.


Every trial package should contain the following four elements:

1. A QR code generated for each package that will be used as a unique ID to track all the information collected during the trial. It is important to tell farmers to keep this code throughout the duration of the trial. [Find out more about QR code generation here.](/design/climmob-setup#8-prepare-test-packages) 

2. Three bags with equal quantities of the technology options (e.g. seeds, fertilizers) or instructions on how to apply the alternative technology options (e.g. tillage systems), according to the randomization that was generated by ClimMob.

3. An observation card where testers will note their on-farm observations. [Find out more about observation cards here.](/design/climmob-setup#7-prepare-observation-cards)

4. A brochure that explains the entire process to the farmer. [Illustrations and other supporting material for communication with farmers can be found here.](/resources/resources#support_material)
