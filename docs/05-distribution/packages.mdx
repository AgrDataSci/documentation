### Every trial package should contain the following four elements:

1. A QR code generated for each package that will be used as a unique ID to track all the information collected during the trial. It is important to tell farmers to keep this code throughout the duration of the trial. (link to ClimMob instructions)

2. Three bags with equal quantities of the technology options (e.g. seeds, fertilizers) or instructions on how to apply the alternative technology options (e.g. tillage systems), according to the randomization that was generated by ClimMob.

3. An observation card where testers will note their on-farm observations. (link to observation card)

4. A brochure that explains the entire process to the farmer.

### How to create rest packages in ClimMob

After setting up your data collection moments and their corresponding questions, the next step is to create test packages through technology randomization. This process ensures that each participant receives a balanced set of technology options for evaluation.

How-to:

1.	On the project overview section (right side of the screen), click Generate packages with technology options to open the participant registration form.

2.	Set combinations:

*	Choose whether to include all technology options or only a selection.

*	Define how many packages with each technology option will be generated.

*	By default, all technology options are included, and the same number of packages are created for each.

*	**WARNING** If you change the number of packages for one technology, you must balance the total by adding or subtracting from others to ensure the same overall number of packages.

3.	Review packages and CONFIRM. If the list of packages is not confirmed, it will be lost, and you will need to repeat the randomization.

4.	Once confirmed, the randomization documents are available in the Downloads section:

*	List of packages with QR codes for the registration form → required for preparing test packages.

*	List with randomized trial packages (Excel) → shows the technology combinations assigned to each package. This file is useful when preparing test packages. **Do not edit this file**.

### Which visual materials are needed?

At ClimMob (www.climmob.net) you will find examples and illustrations to help you generate your own visual materials. In order to explain the process to your tricot farmers and to facilitate the data collection, the following materials can support you:

• Informative leaflet or poster, as an aid to explain the tricot process to the farmers.

• Observation card, for the farmers to collect their observations on the field. It is designed to enable participation with a minimal level of literacy.

### Prepare observation cards

In this step, you define and manage the questions that participants will answer during their tricot trial about the performance of their assigned technology options. These are always comparison questions, allowing participants to rank their field observations. The finalized questions will be printed on the observation cards that are handed out to participants.

How-to (two steps):

1. Define time points

Decide when participants should make their observations during the trial.

Example: For a bean variety test, you might ask participants to observe at three stages:

*	Day of sowing (start of the project).
*	30 days after sowing (mid-point).
*	Day of harvest (end of the trial).

2. Define observations

Based on the technology options being tested, determine which specific observations participants should make.

Each observation corresponds to one question on the observation card.

Example:

*	Plant height → “Which variety grows tallest?”
*	Stress tolerance → “Which variety looks healthiest?”

### Prepare test packages

Once your technologies have been randomized, the next step is to create the physical packages that participants will use for the blind testing.

How-to (three steps):

1.	Gather materials

*	Collect enough of each technology option that you are testing.

*	Example: If you are testing seed varieties, gather sufficient quantities of each seed type.

2. Download package lists from ClimMob (in the Downloads section):

*	Randomized trial packages list → shows which combination of three technology options goes into each package.

*	Package list with QR codes for participant registration → contains the package number and its unique QR code.

3.	Prepare and label the packages

*	Assemble each package with its assigned set of three technology options.

*	Cut out the corresponding label (from the package list with QR codes).

*	Stick the label with the package number and QR code on the package before distributing it to participants.

### Connect ClimMob with ODK Collect

To collect project data in an efficient and user-friendly way, you can link your ClimMob project with ODK Collect.

To install [ODK Collect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android) on your **Android** device, go to the Google Play Store.

How-to (four steps):

1.	Install ODK Collect

*	Each field agent downloads and installs ODK Collect on their Android phone or tablet.

*	Note: ODK Collect is only available for **Android devices**.

2.	Obtain field agent QR codes from ClimMob

*	Once your field agents are registered in the platform, download the file “List with field agents and their QR codes to configure ODK Collect” from the Downloads section.

3.	Configure ODK Collect

Each field agent opens ODK Collect, taps the three-dot menu (upper-right corner), and selects “Configure via QR code”.

*	They scan their assigned QR code from the ClimMob list.

*	Note: The app may request permission to use the phone camera — allow access to complete the setup.

4.	Access and open the forms

*	In ODK Collect, tap “Get Blank Form”.

*	The project’s data collection form will download and be ready to use.

### Register participants and distribute packages

Once you have prepared the packages with the different technology options, it is time to go to the field to distribute them and register each participant with their corresponding trial package.

How-to:

There are different ways to do this: you can arrange a meeting with all participants or visit them individually at their location.

**Using ODK Collect**

1.	Open ODK Collect and get the blank registration form.

2.	Fill in the form with participant data. The first step is to scan the QR code attached to the package with the three technology options the participant is receiving. This links the package to their individual profile.

3.	Once the forms are completed, send them to the server.

**Paper** (NOT RECOMMENDED, as it takes significantly more time and is more prone to errors):

1.	Alternatively, you can register participants using paper forms. These are available under Downloads → Printer-friendly registration form.

2.	Enter the data into an Excel file. On the main menu (left side), click on Upload data (green button) → Create template. The template will be generated and available in Downloads → Excel template for uploading registration form data.

3.	Once you have filled in the template, go back to the main menu, click on Upload data (green button, left side), and upload the Excel document.

Review, edit and complete registration:

●	Click on the green button View data to review the submitted data and edit if necessary.

●	Click on the red button, Finish registration once you have registered all participants.

⚠️ **Please note:** This step cannot be undone, so only proceed when you are certain that registration is complete.
