### Every trial package should contain the following four elements:

1. A QR code generated for each package that will be used as a unique ID to track all the information collected during the trial. It is important to tell farmers to keep this code throughout the duration of the trial. [Find out more about QR code generation here] (https://agrdatasci.github.io/documentation/design/climmob-setup#7-prepare-test-packages)

2. Three bags with equal quantities of the technology options (e.g. seeds, fertilizers) or instructions on how to apply the alternative technology options (e.g. tillage systems), according to the randomization that was generated by ClimMob.

3. An observation card where testers will note their on-farm observations. [Find out more about observation cards here] (https://agrdatasci.github.io/documentation/design/climmob-setup#7-prepare-observation-cards)

4. A brochure that explains the entire process to the farmer. Illustrations and other supporting material for communication with farmers [here](./faq-and resources/resources.mdx#support_material)
