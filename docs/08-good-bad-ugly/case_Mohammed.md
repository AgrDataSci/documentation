# Tricot evaluation in Ethiopia - Mohammed Hassena, Integrated Seed Sector Development, Ethiopia

1.	Why did you use Tricot? 

We decided to use tricot because farmers in isolated areas do not have access to varieties provided by extension programs and we wanted to reach more farmers in those areas.

2.	What lessons did you learn using tricot?  

Initially we thought it would be a complex process, but we learned that it is relatively easy because we established partnerships with local people. It also allowed us to include many farmers in different areas. Our staff was struggling with some of the data collection, but it was easily solved in the software. 

3.	How was the farmers’ participation?

Farmers were very interested because of the different varieties that were evaluated. They were happy to give their answers.

4.	What insights did you get from onsite trials?

In areas where there are less varieties and extension services, it is very good and easy to introduce new varieties through trials to see which farmers prefer. But for private companies that test existing varieties, it might be difficult for them to accept farmers’ feedback if it is not in the favor of varieties that are already released. So there could be some reservation from those companies to use tricot.

5.	What advice do you have for someone who wants to use tricot?  

For companies that want to target a certain area, tricot is the best way to identify new varieties that are liked by farmers. For companies who test already released varieties, it is also good because it helps promote those varieties. However, companies must take care when naming the varieties because farmers that tested them may have named them and if companies release them under another name, it can create confusion.

6.	Do you think the tricot approach is appropriate for variety introduction? 

Yes, it is good, because if you include a variety in tricot farmers will already know it and when it is released adoption rates will be higher.

7.	What are the challenges that need to be addressed? 

At first when someone wants to target a large number of farmers, it may feel logistically challenging and expensive to do, but it is actually easy, especially if you partner with local people. Also, farmers multiplying the varieties is ok because it is part of the promotion of the varieties.
