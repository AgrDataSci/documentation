# Product testing with users in agriculture and food: 
## Decentralized on-farm evaluation, breeding product validation, consumer testing and other applications using the tricot approach.

This is an online reference on everything dealing with on farm testing (OFT) using tricot. The *tricot* approach (triadic comparison of technology options) is a participatory, decentralized method where participants test three randomly assigned options on their use context. Using citizen science, it integrates participatory insights and site-specific data to guide breeding and agricultural innovation. Scalable and cost-effective, tricot empowers farmers and enhances crop diversity and resilience.
