## Introducing ClimMob: A software platform for experimental citizen science in agriculture{#intro_climmob}

[ClimMob](https://1000farms.climmob.net/) supports tricot trial implementers in evaluating technology options across diverse contexts with a one-platform solution to design, manage, and share experiments. It helps implementers plan and monitor processes while ensuring that relevant outputs reach researchers, field agents, and trial participants at the right time. This enables effective trial operations and agile, data-based decisions, underpinned by an excellent user experience.

ClimMob is a **free, open-source, online platform** for participatory testing projects. It guides users through all stages of their tricot projects: from project design and generation of randomized test packages, to efficient data collection, automated analysis, and reporting.

●	Current version: ClimMob 3

●	Data collection: via the Android app ODK Collect 

●	Analysis: uses the R package ClimMobTools

Requirements: An Android smartphone or tablet for field data collection

### Why ClimMob?

Participatory testing in agriculture can be complex, involving multiple actors—such as project implementers, field agents, and farmers—often across different regions or countries. These projects generate large volumes of data that must be organized, validated, and analyzed.

ClimMob was custom-built to streamline this complexity by supporting:

●	Project design and planning

●	Generation of randomized test packages

●	Efficient data collection and storage

●	Monitoring of data and project progress

●	Automated data analysis and reporting

By simplifying all stages of the workflow, ClimMob makes tricot projects more manageable, scalable, and successful.

### Software architecture and design principles

a.	Design philosophy

ClimMob’s architecture was shaped by the need for a feasible and project-owner-oriented workflow, while also addressing the requirements of breeders, researchers, and field agents. The platform is designed primarily for scientists and project coordinators who lead participatory trials, ensuring they can manage projects efficiently while keeping outputs relevant for farmers and decision-makers. The software and workflow were developed in parallel to ensure technical coherence, usability, and alignment with real-world project management needs.

b.	Component-based engineering

ClimMob is built using Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE). This allows for a flexible and modular platform that is easy to update and maintain.

c.	Open-source foundation

ClimMob is based on robust, widely adopted open-source components, including:

●	Open Data Kit (ODK)

●	ODK Tools

●	PyUtilib Component Architecture

All data analysis is conducted through R packages, particularly the ClimMobTools package, ensuring reproducibility and transparency.

### User-centered development

From the beginning, ClimMob has followed an iterative and user-centered development process, marked by:

●	Ongoing feedback from users

●	Short communication loops between developers and field teams

●	Continuous improvements based on real-world use

This has resulted in a platform that adapts to the evolving needs of agricultural innovation projects.

### Who uses ClimMob—and How?

ClimMob was built to support a range of users within participatory testing projects:

a.	Implementers (project leaders)

They benefit from tools for project setup, assigning field agents, and managing test packages. ClimMob also offers automatic statistical reports, enabling data-informed decision-making.

b.	Field Agents

They register participants and collect data using the ODK Collect app. This ensures data entry is quick, efficient, and synchronized with ClimMob.

c.	Testers (farmers or participants)

They receive their test results soon after data submission. This rapid feedback helps them learn from peers and adopt the most promising technologies.

### What’s next for ClimMob?

Ongoing development of ClimMob focuses on:

●	Improving user experience (UI/UX)

●	Expanding data types and media (e.g. audio, photos, sensor data)

●	Enhancing integration with other platforms

### Get familiar with ClimMob 

When users log into ClimMob for the first time, they are welcomed with a guided setup designed to help them configure the platform before creating their first project. This workflow ensures that key components are defined early, streamlining future project setup.

### Navigate the main menu

The main menu is located on the left side of the screen and gives access to key areas of the platform, including your projects, library items, and tools.

Here is the order in which these onboarding messages appear:

#### Libraries

Libraries are centralized repositories for elements that will be reused in multiple projects, such as agents, technologies, and questions.

●	Field agents: are the individuals responsible for registering farmers and collecting data in the field. You’ll define them once and assign them across multiple projects.

●	Technologies: are the options that farmers will evaluate—for example, different seed varieties, soil treatments, or planting methods. These are stored in the library for future use.

●	Questions: ClimMob provides a rich library of premade evaluation questions developed by the 1000FARMS team, available in multiple languages and ready to use across projects. This library helps ensure consistency and comparability in data collection. In addition, you can also define your own custom questions—such as “Which variety grew fastest?” or “Which option tasted better?”—which will then be stored and reused in future projects.

#### Downloads 

This menu option gives access to tools and resources needed for field implementation, including:

●	Field data collection templates

●	Survey forms

●	ClimMob documentation

●	R analysis tools

## Setting up a new project {#create_project}

### 1. Create a new project

To start working with ClimMob, your first step is to create a new project. You can do this in two ways: either by going to the Project overview section and clicking Create a new project, or by navigating to All projects and selecting Add new project. In both cases, you will be asked to complete a short form with the main project details. Once created, you can always return later to update or adjust the project settings.

To set up a profile for your tricot project. Fields to fill:

1) General information

   ● Project name: Unique and more descriptive name for the project. We recommend including the technology, the year or time, and the location, to distinguish the project from others, when you manage multiple projects. For example: Bean_Honduras_2019_season1  

   ● Project ID: Short, unique identifier of the project. For example, your initials and year of the project: JV19.  

   ● Description: Add more detail about the project.  

   ● Keywords: To make your project searchable, enter up to X keywords that define your project. Examples: “bean”, “Honduras”.  

   ● Trial coordinator: Your full name, start with your first name, all names separated by a space. By default, it is already filled with your data. Change if the trial coordinator is someone else.  

   ● Email address: Your email address.  

   ● Affiliation: Select one or create a new affiliation, if any of the options applies to your organization.  

2) Geographic information

   ●	Select the country where the project will take place

3) Participants

   ●	Number of participants: Enter how many participants will join this project. For example: 200. If you don’t know the exact number yet, better choose a number too high than too low (but still reasonable, as otherwise ClimMob will do a lot of unnecessary computing later on).

4) Technology options labels

   ●	Number of technology options each participant compares: By default, this is set to ‘3’ and cannot be changed. It’s a reminder that in a tricot project, every participant will receive 3 technology options to compare.

   ●	Name given to the 3 items that each participant compares: by default the names are “Option A, Option B and Option C” but the trial coordinator could decide to change them for something else that participants can relate to better, such as numbers, colors or shapes.

5) Project type

   ●	You can indicate whether the project is a training project. This means the project was created for educational purposes—such as practice, demonstrations, or coursework—and not intended for actual data collection in the field.

   ●	There are three options for experimental site: on-farm testing, home, or public space (e.g., market). Depending on the experimental site selected, you will need to choose between different units of analysis and corresponding objectives (see examples in box below).
   
   ●	Do you want to create your project from a template? Select if it applies to your project.

   ●	Finally, you can select up to four languages in which the participant forms will be provided, allowing multilingual data collection as needed.

### 2. Assign field agents

In this section, you can add the field agents who will work on this particular project. Field agents are your extension workers in the field who will communicate with the participants and later collect all trial observations using the ODK Collect app.

1.	On the project overview section, click on Assign field agents.

2.	If the fields agents you want to work with are already on the left list, just select the ones you would like to work with in this project.

3.	If you would like to add new field agents, click on +add new field agent. This will redirect you to the library of field agents, where you can add the information about a new field agent. 

*Note that the field password and username are necessary for ODK Collect.

### 3. Select technology options

In this section, you can specify the technology options you want to compare in your tricot experiment. We recommend you select a pool of 7 to 20 technology options.

For example, if you want to test which bean variety of a pool of 7 to 20 bean varieties is best adapted to the region you are running your tricot experiment in, you would add the names of all bean varieties here. If you want to include 7 bean varieties in the experiment, or 20, or anything in between, depends on the experiment you have in mind.

If you want to test which fertilizer regime of a pool of 10 to 20 different fertilizer regimes makes crops grow best, you would add the names of these 10 to 20 fertilizer regimes here.

How-to:

1.	On the project overview section click on green button, Select technology options.

2.	You will access the list of available technologies in the platform. If the technology you are interested in is there, just click on it and access the different options (e.g. varieties).

3.	If the technology you are interested in is not there, click on + add new technology. This action will redirect you to the library, where you can create new technologies.

**Video tutorial**

### 4. Prepare participant registration form

In this section, you can add and manage the administrative questions that field agents will ask participants during registration at the start of the project. These questions are important for two main reasons:

●	Administrative purposes: to keep a clear record of who is participating, where they live, and other key details that help organize and monitor the trial.

●	Data analysis purposes: to allow deeper insights, for example, checking whether younger participants adopt a technology faster, or whether female participants show a preference for certain options.
Once you have defined the list of questions, they will be available through the ODK Collect app. Field agents can then enter participant information directly into the app during registration.

How-to:

1.	On the project definition section, click Prepare participant registration form.

2.	Drag the questions you want to include from the left panel (available questions from the library) into the middle panel (assessment form). A preview of the selected questions will appear on the right panel (preview)—scroll down to see all of them.

3.	If the question you want is not available in the library, click Add new question and create it under the most relevant section.

4.	The ClimMob library already includes a list of commonly used questions, which you can easily add to the registration form.

**Video tutorials**

Learn in the following video how to prepare the participant registration form and set up the randomization for the ClimMob project.

### 5. Prepare data collection form

In this section, you define the different data collection moments for the on-farm evaluation that participants will carry out. At each moment, specific questions will be asked to capture observations. It is important to decide:

●	Which traits will be evaluated in the selected technology options?

●	When will each trait be evaluated during the planting cycle?

Once set up, these data collection forms will guide field agents and participants during the evaluation process.

How-to:

1.	On the project definition section, click Prepare data collection. Here you can add the different data collection moments throughout the planting cycle.

2.	After adding the data collection moments, go to the right panel (Active data collection moments) and click Show to view them.

3.	For each data collection moment, drag the desired questions from the left panel (available questions from the library) into the middle panel (assessment form). A preview of the selected questions will appear on the right panel (preview)—scroll down to view all questions.

4.	If the question you need is not in the library, click Add new question and create it under the most relevant section.

**Video tutorials**

### 6. Technology randomization

After setting up your data collection moments and their corresponding questions, the next step is to create test packages through technology randomization. This process ensures that each participant receives a balanced set of technology options for evaluation.

How-to:

1. On the project overview section (right side of the screen), click Generate packages with technology options to open the participant registration form.

2. Set combinations:

* Choose whether to include all technology options or only a selection.

* Define how many packages with each technology option will be generated.

* By default, all technology options are included, and the same number of packages are created for each.

**WARNING** If you change the number of packages for one technology, you must balance the total by adding or subtracting from others to ensure the same overall number of packages.

3. Review packages and CONFIRM. If the list of packages is not confirmed, it will be lost, and you will need to repeat the randomization.

4. Once confirmed, the randomization documents are available in the Downloads section:

* List of packages with QR codes for the registration form → required for preparing test packages.

* List with randomized trial packages (Excel) → shows the technology combinations assigned to each package. This file is useful when preparing test packages. Do not edit this file.

### 7. Prepare observation cards

_link to other section?_

In this step, you define and manage the questions that participants will answer during their tricot trial about the performance of their assigned technology options. These are always comparison questions, allowing participants to rank their field observations. The finalized questions will be printed on the observation cards that are handed out to participants.

How-to (two steps):

1. Define time points

Decide when participants should make their observations during the trial.

Example: For a bean variety test, you might ask participants to observe at three stages:

* Day of sowing (start of the project)
* 30 days after sowing (mid-point)
* Day of harvest (end of the trial)

2. Define observations

Based on the technology options being tested, determine which specific observations participants should make.

Each observation corresponds to one question on the observation card.

Example:

* Plant height → “Which variety grows tallest?”
* Stress tolerance → “Which variety looks healthiest?”

![Observation sheet for crop variety evaluation](/img/observation_sheet.png)

### 8. Prepare test packages

Once your technologies have been randomized, the next step is to create the physical packages that participants will use for the blind testing.

How-to (three steps):

1. Gather materials

* Collect enough of each technology option that you are testing.

* Example: If you are testing seed varieties, gather sufficient quantities of each seed type.

2. Download package lists from ClimMob (in the Downloads section):

* Randomized trial packages list → shows which combination of three technology options goes into each package.

* Package list with QR codes for participant registration → contains the package number and its unique QR code.

3. Prepare and label the packages

* Assemble each package with its assigned set of three technology options.

* Cut out the corresponding label (from the package list with QR codes).

* Stick the label with the package number and QR code on the package before distributing it to participants.

### 9. Connect ClimMob with ODK Collect

To collect project data in an efficient and user-friendly way, you can link your ClimMob project with ODK Collect.

To install ODK Collect on your Android device, go to the Google Play Store.

How-to (four steps):

1. Install ODK Collect

* Each field agent downloads and installs ODK Collect on their Android phone or tablet.

* Note: ODK Collect is only available for Android devices.

2. Obtain field agent QR codes from ClimMob

Once your field agents are registered in the platform, download the file “List with field agents and their QR codes to configure ODK Collect” from the Downloads section.

3. Configure ODK Collect

Each field agent opens ODK Collect, taps the three-dot menu (upper-right corner), and selects “Configure via QR code”.

* They scan their assigned QR code from the ClimMob list.

* Note: The app may request permission to use the phone camera — allow access to complete the setup.

4. Access and open the forms

* In ODK Collect, tap “Get Blank Form”.

* The project’s data collection form will download and be ready to use.


### 10. Register participants and distribute packages

Once you have prepared the packages with the different technology options, it is time to go to the field to distribute them and register each participant with their corresponding trial package.

How-to:

There are different ways to do this: you can arrange a meeting with all participants or visit them individually at their location.

**Using ODK Collect**

1. Open ODK Collect and get the blank registration form.

2. Fill in the form with participant data. The first step is to scan the QR code attached to the package with the three technology options the participant is receiving. This links the package to their individual profile.

3. Once the forms are completed, send them to the server.

**Paper** (NOT RECOMMENDED, as it takes significantly more time and is more prone to errors):

1. Alternatively, you can register participants using paper forms. These are available under Downloads → Printer-friendly registration form.

2. Enter the data into an Excel file. On the main menu (left side), click on Upload data (green button) → Create template. The template will be generated and available in Downloads → Excel template for uploading registration form data.

3. Once you have filled in the template, go back to the main menu, click on Upload data (green button, left side), and upload the Excel document.

Review, edit and complete registration:

* Click on the green button View data to review the submitted data and edit if necessary.

* Click on the red button, Finish registration once you have registered all participants.

⚠️ Please note: This step cannot be undone, so only proceed when you are certain that registration is complete.

### 11. Start an assessment

Once participants have been registered and packages have been distributed, the on-farm trials can begin, and data collection (assessment) takes place.

How-to:

Data can be collected in different ways and at different time frames, depending on the project managers’ preferences:

* If participants have observation cards, their trial data can be collected at the end of the planting cycle.

* If participants do not have observation cards, field agents should visit them at each data collection point to record their observations.

Field agents can collect data in two ways:

1. Using ODK Collect (recommended).

2. Uploading data to the ClimMob platform through an Excel file.

On the ClimMob platform:

1. Once all participants are registered, go to the project overview section (bottom left side).

2. From the drop-down menu, select the data collection moment you want to assess and click Start assessment.

3. Upload the data for that specific data collection moment. (Learn more about data uploading in the next step!)

4. When finished, move on to the next data collection moment.

### 12. Trial data collection

Once farmers have started their on-farm trials, the next step is to collect the data generated at the different data collection moments. For each moment, ClimMob generates a specific form with tailored questions. Data can be collected using ODK Collect (recommended) or, alternatively, by uploading an Excel file to the ClimMob platform.

Using ODK Collect (recommended)

1. Each field agent opens ODK Collect on their phone.

2. Tap the three dots (top-right) → Get blank form → select the data collection form.

3. For the first data collection moment:

* Choose Fill blank form

* Select the participant

* Enter the data

* Send the finalized form

4. Back in the ClimMob platform, the project administrator must:

* Check the collected data and correct if necessary (from the main dashboard, click View data on the right side and select the parameters to review).

* Once verified, go to the main menu, finish the first data collection, and start the next assessment.

5. Repeat this process until all data collection points are completed.
Actions in ODK Collect:

Cancel form: Permanently deletes the form. No further data can be collected, and any existing data will also be deleted. Using Excel (not recommended)

1. In the ClimMob dashboard, go to the main menu (left side) and click Upload data (green button).

2. Click Create template. The Excel template will be generated and saved in your Downloads as Excel template for uploading assessment form data.

3. Fill in the template with the collected data.

4. Return to the ClimMob main menu → Upload data (green button) → upload the completed Excel file.

**Submit data from a browser**

To fill out forms online supported by Enketo, the field agents (enumerators) need to log in using their credentials (username and password). Here we do a quick explanation on how to register a new field agent, that subsequently will login to Enketo to submit data from a browser.

Visit the Field Agents section in the main menu:


![](/img/menu.JPG)
---
Fill in the form with the credentials of the field agent.

![](/img/field_credentials.JPG)

---

Verify that the field agent has been successfully created in the list of registered field agents:

![](/img/registered_field.JPG)

---

In the project definition, select “Assign field agents”:

![](/img/assign_menu.JPG)

---

Select the field agent(s):

![](/img/assign.JPG)

---

Click on the “Add field agents” button and verify that the user has been assigned to the project.

![](/img/field_project.JPG)

---

In the main menu, visit the form you wish to fill out using the browser and click on the “Submit data from a browser” button to display the form:

![](/img/submit.JPG)

---

Now the form will be displayed and request the field agent credentials that were registered in the Library.

![](/img/credentials.JPG)


---

Once the credentials are provided, the form to be filled in will be displayed:

![](/img/form.JPG)

---

In the case of the Registration Form, you need to replace the QR code (used in ODK Collect) by a code that follows the pattern: projectownerusername-packagenumber-projectcode~

For example, if the project owner username is: ballen and the project code: prj01 and you assign the package #30 you should write as follows: ballen-30-prj01~

Remember to keep the ~ sign at the end so ClimMob can read the entire code.

### 13. Trial Documentation

Trial Documentation is a key step to ensure that your project records are complete and ready for analysis. This feature allows you to keep track of all the essential aspects of your trial through a set of forms.

You can start filling out these forms at any moment during the project, beginning from its creation. Some forms are typically completed at the start, while others are filled in at the end. **However, all forms must be completed before moving on to the Data Analysis step and downloading reports.**

The Trial documentation section includes the following eight forms:

1. Contributors

Document the organizations, researchers, or institutions involved in the project, including their roles and responsibilities. This helps acknowledge contributions and ensures transparency.

2. Project design

Describe the structure of the trial: experimental design, partners who contribute with the trial, describe any special features of the trial and select the target environment of the trial. Environmental options come from the agroecological zones utilized on Global Market Intelligents Platform (GloMip) https://glomip.cgiar.org/market-segments.

3. Market segment 

Identify the market segment to which the project is associated. For consistency, the classification should follow the categories defined in the GloMip platform. https://glomip.cgiar.org/market-segments.

4. Participants 

Record how the sample size was calculated and how participants were selected.

When describing selection criteria, consider aspects such as:

* Prior studies: whether participants were chosen based on their inclusion in existing surveys, experiments.

* Datasets: whether participants were chosen based on their inclusion in community records.

* Knowledge and skills: if participants were selected due to their farming expertise, familiarity with certain crops, or ability to manage trials effectively.

* Gender: whether the project aimed for gender balance, targeted women or men specifically, or followed a quota system.

* Experience with the analyzed crop: how participants’ familiarity with the crop under evaluation influenced their inclusion in the trial.

* Household selection based on survey data: whether socioeconomic conditions, landholding size, or family composition played a role in participant selection.

For recruitment strategies, specify whether participants were:

* Open recruitment through public announcements, posters, or radio messages.

* Invited through their organizations, such as cooperatives, farmer associations, or NGOs.

When reporting recruitment locations, describe the physical or social spaces where participants were engaged—such as community centers, marketplaces, cooperative meetings, or local government facilities.

Finally, detail how informed consent was obtained. This could include:

* Verbal consent, documented by facilitators during recruitment.

* Individual signed forms, providing a written record of participation.

* Community-level authorization, where a recognized leader or representative grants approval on behalf of a group.

In all cases, the option “Other” is always available, allowing you to enter a description when the predefined choices do not fit.

5. Tricot training

Capture details of the training sessions provided to participants. Indicate who facilitated the sessions and how tricot methodology was explained.

Specify, on what instructions were given regarding the trial:

* Agronomic management – guidance on crop care practices such as planting density, irrigation, weeding, or pest management.

* Trial setup – instructions on how to establish the tricot trial, including plot arrangement, randomization of varieties, and labeling.

* Food preparation methods – in cases where evaluation involves sensory testing, training on standardized preparation and cooking methods.

* Other – any additional type of instruction not captured above.

Note whether the training was conducted:

* Individually – one-on-one training with each participant.

* In groups – collective sessions with multiple participants at the same time.

* Other – any alternative training format.

Describe follow-up procedures to ensure compliance and timely data collection, such as additional visits, reminder calls, or digital monitoring.

Also specify any additional inputs provided to participants, for example:

* Fertilizers – chemical or organic fertilizers distributed as part of the trial.

* Agrochemicals – pesticides, fungicides, or herbicides supplied to participants.

* Other – any other input provided that does not fit the listed categories.

6. Data collection

Describe the methods used for data collection, such as phone calls, farm visits, or lead farmer interviews. Indicate the tools applied in the process, including ODK Collect, Enketo, or Excel sheets.

7. Results communication

Document how trial results were shared with participants. Options may include group meetings, information sheets, individual visits, or other relevant formats.

8. Varieties

Provide details about the varieties or technologies tested in the trial. This includes the genotype name, the type of entry (historical check, farmer check, commercial check, comparative check, evaluation entry, release candidate, or replacement candidate), and the target traits under evaluation (e.g., drought tolerance, pest or disease resistance, product quality, yield, or other traits as specified).

### 14. Project overview

The Project overview is the starting point of any ClimMob project. It guides you through the essential steps required to set up, manage, and share your research trial. Each section builds on the previous one, ensuring that your project is well-structured and ready for implementation.

Project profile: define the basic details of your project. Here you set up the project title, description, objectives, and key identifiers that will allow others to understand its purpose at a glance.

Assign field agents: select the team members or collaborators who will collect data in the field. Assigning field agents ensures that responsibilities are clear, and data collection is organized.

Assign technologies: choose the agricultural technologies or practices that will be tested in your trial. These could include new crop varieties, fertilizers, or management techniques.

Prepare participant registration form: design the form that will be used to register farmers or participants in your project. This form collects key demographic and contextual information, making it possible to analyze results across different participant groups.

Prepare trial data collection: set up the data collection forms that participants or field agents will use during the trial. These forms capture observations, feedback, and results, ensuring standardized and comparable data.

Trial documentation: upload or create documentation related to your trial, such as protocols, manuals, or additional reference material. This helps maintain transparency and ensures that all collaborators follow the same procedures.

Share project with other users: Invite colleagues, partners, or stakeholders to view or collaborate on your project. Sharing increases transparency, improves teamwork, and allows for broader use of the collected data.
